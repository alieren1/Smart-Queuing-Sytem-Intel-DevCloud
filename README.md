## Main Tasks

1. Propose a possible hardware solution
2. Build out your application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
3. Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
4. Revise your proposal based on the test results

## Project:

1. [Manufacturing Scenario](./Manufacturing_Scenario.ipynb) 
2. [Retail Scenario](./Retail_Scenario.ipynb)
3. [Transportation Scenario](./Transportation_Scenario.ipynb)

## Steps:

1. Create the Python script
2. Create the Job Submission script
3. Execute all the scenarios for all hardware types (CPU, GPU, VPU & FPGA) and compare the performance.
